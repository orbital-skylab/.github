Thank you to all who wish to contribute to the development of Skylab V2 :smiley:

## For New Contributors

Do read our [Getting Started](https://github.com/orbital-skylab#getting-started) guide to set up your development environment and get familiar with our coding conventions as well as Git and issue tracking workflows. 
You can also contact our developers to be added to our Jira project.

## Picking Up and Creating Tickets

Our [Jira kanban board](https://orbital-skylab.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/OS/boards/1) tracks all open issues in the form of tickets.

You can look through the tickets in the `Backlog` column to see if there are any tickets you would be able to work on.
To pick it up, simply click on the ticket and assign it to yourself, then move the ticket into the `In Progress` column.

If you managed to find an untracked bug or there is a new feature that you would like to work on, you can create a ticket for this new task.

Categorize this newly created ticket under the most appropriate `Epic`. If there is no fitting `Epic` currently in the project, feel free to add a new one.

Do remember to provide the necessary details about the task in the description section of the ticket. 

## Writing Code

Begin by creating a new branch as specified in our [Git Workflow](https://github.com/orbital-skylab/skylab-frontend/wiki/Git-Workflow).

During the process of writing your code to implement a new feature or bugfix, ensure to commit frequently using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) framework as specified in our Git Workflow.

Do also ensure to abide by our coding conventions and best practices as specified in our [Style Guide](https://github.com/orbital-skylab/skylab-frontend/wiki/Style-Guide)

## Creating a Pull Request

Once you have completed writing your code, you can create a pull request and request a review from another contributor for your branch to be merged.

Reviewers will assess your code using our [Code Review Rubrics](https://github.com/orbital-skylab/skylab-frontend/wiki/Code-Review-Rubrics), so do give this a read to ensure that your commits fulfil all the highlighted criteria
Reviewers may comment and/or request changes before approving your pull request. Feel free to reach out to reviewers to seek further clarification if necessary, and work with them to resolve all requested changes.

Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged by the reviewer.
